# EgyptFi Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

The **EgyptFi** contract is a comprehensive payment processing and yield optimization platform built on Starknet. It enables merchants to register, manage KYC proofs, process USDC payments, handle withdrawals and refunds, and automatically allocate funds across multiple yield-generating pools (e.g., Vesu pools) for optimized returns. The contract supports multi-pool strategies where merchants can customize allocations (in basis points) for depositing net payments into various liquidity pools, with the remainder held in a vault for liquidity.

Key features:
- **Merchant Management**: Registration, updates, deactivation, and metadata handling.
- **KYC Integration**: Merchants can set and verify proof hashes for compliance.
- **Payment Processing**: Create, process, and verify payments with platform fees.
- **Yield Optimization**: Automatic distribution of funds to multiple pools; claim or compound yields.
- **Admin Controls**: Emergency pause, fee updates, pool registry, and platform fee management.
- **Security**: Uses OpenZeppelin components for ownership, reentrancy protection, and upgradability.
- **Token**: Primarily handles USDC (ERC20) for payments and transfers.

The contract interacts with external Vesu pools via the `IVesuPool` interface for deposits, redemptions, and yield calculations.

**Deployment Notes**:
- Upgradable via OpenZeppelin.
- Assumes USDC is pre-approved for transfers.
- All percentages are in basis points (e.g., 10000 = 100%).

## Constructor Parameters

The constructor initializes core configuration and security components. It must be called during deployment (or proxy initialization for upgradable contracts).

```rust
fn constructor(
    ref self: ContractState,
    owner: ContractAddress,  // Initial owner address (admin) with full control over admin functions.
    usdc_token: ContractAddress,  // ERC20 USDC contract address for all transfers and payments.
    platform_fee_percentage: u16,  // Initial platform fee in basis points (e.g., 100 = 1%; max 500/5% enforced later).
    platform_fee_collector: ContractAddress,  // Designated collector for fees (unused in current impl; fees accrue to platform vault/pool).
    min_payment_amount_usd: u256,  // Minimum USDC amount for payments to prevent spam/dust.
)
```

**Post-Initialization Defaults**:
- `emergency_pause`: `false`.
- `platform_vault_balance`: `0`.
- `platform_pool_id`: `0` (must be set via `set_platform_pool_id`).
- `platform_pool_allocation`: `5000` (50% of fees to pool, 50% to vault).

These params cannot be changed post-deployment except via admin functions (e.g., `update_platform_fee`).

## Major Storage States to Update for Use

Post-deployment, several key storage states require updates via admin or merchant functions to enable full functionality. Below is a table of major states, their initial values, update methods, and rationale for use. Updates are protected by access controls (e.g., `ownable.assert_only_owner()` for admin states).

| State | Type | Initial Value | Update Method | Updater | Rationale/When to Update |
|-------|------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------------------------|
| `usdc_token` | `ContractAddress` | Set in constructor | N/A (immutable post-deploy) | Admin (constructor) | Core token; update only on redeploy if changing stablecoin. |
| `platform_fee_percentage` | `u16` (basis points) | Set in constructor (e.g., 100) | `update_platform_fee(new_fee_percentage: u16)` | Admin | Adjust fees based on business model; enforce ≤500 (5%). |
| `min_payment_amount_usd` | `u256` | Set in constructor (e.g., 100000000) | `update_min_payment_amount(new_min_amount: u256)` | Admin | Tune for network gas/economics; prevents low-value txs. |
| `emergency_pause` | `bool` | `false` | `toggle_emergency_pause()` | Admin | Emergency halt; toggle during exploits or maintenance. |
| `platform_pool_id` | `felt252` | `0` | `set_platform_pool_id(pool_id: felt252)` | Admin | Assign pool for fee allocation; requires active pool. |
| `platform_pool_allocation` | `u16` (basis points) | `5000` (50%) | `update_platform_pool_allocation(allocation_bp: u16)` | Admin | Balance liquidity vs. yield for platform fees; ≤10000. |
| **Pool Registry** (e.g., `supported_pools`, `pool_active`) | Maps | Empty | `register_pool(...)` / `deactivate_pool(pool_id: felt252)` | Admin | Onboard new Vesu pools; activate/deactivate as needed. |
| `merchant_pool_allocations` (per merchant/pool) | `Map<(ContractAddress, felt252), u16>` | `0` | `set_multi_pool_allocation(...)` / `add_pool_to_strategy(...)` / `update_pool_allocation(...)` | Merchant | Customize yield strategy; total ≤10000 across pools. |
| `platform_vault_balance` | `u256` | `0` | Accrues via payments; withdraw via `admin_withdraw_fees(amount: u256, to: ContractAddress)` | Admin | Manage accumulated fees; withdraw to treasury. |

**Best Practices**:
- **Admin Setup Sequence**: After deploy, register pools → set platform pool ID/allocation → update fees/min if needed.
- **Merchant Onboarding**: Merchants update allocations before processing payments to enable yield.
- **Monitoring**: Use view functions (e.g., `get_all_pools`, `get_multi_pool_positions`) for state checks.
- **Migration/Upgrade**: On upgrade, verify states (e.g., via scripts); principal/yield tracking relies on accurate `merchant_pool_deposits`/`shares`.

Failure to update these (e.g., no pools set) results in funds defaulting to vault only, reducing yield potential.

## Custom Types

### Structs

#### `Merchant`
Represents a registered merchant's state.

```rust
#[derive(Drop, Serde, Copy, starknet::Store)]
struct Merchant {
    is_active: bool, 
    usdc_balance: u256,  // Vault balance (non-pooled funds)
    total_payments_received: u256,  // Cumulative net USDC received
    total_payments_count: u64,  // Total payments processed
    withdrawal_address: ContractAddress,  // Address for withdrawals
    metadata_hash: felt252,  // IPFS or similar hash for merchant metadata
    joined_timestamp: u64,  // Registration timestamp
}
```

#### `Payment`

```rust
#[derive(Drop, Serde, Copy, starknet::Store)]
struct Payment {
    payment_id: felt252,  // Unique Poseidon hash-based ID
    merchant: ContractAddress,
    customer: ContractAddress,
    amount_paid: u256,  // Input amount (e.g., in native tokens, but treated as USDC equivalent)
    usdc_amount: u256,  // Actual USDC settled
    platform_fee: u256,  // Fee deducted
    status: PaymentStatus,
    timestamp: u64,

}
```

#### `PoolInfo`
Details of a registered yield pool.

```rust
#[derive(Drop, Serde, Copy, starknet::Store)]
struct PoolInfo {
    pool_id: felt252,  // Unique identifier
    pool_address: ContractAddress,  // Vesu pool contract address
    pool_name: felt252,  // Human-readable name (e.g., 'Re7')
    pool_type: felt252,  // Type (e.g., 'Stablecoin', 'ETH')
    is_active: bool,
}
```

### Enums

#### `PaymentStatus`

## Usage Flow

1. **Admin Setup**: Deploy, register pools, set platform pool/allocations.
2. **Merchant Onboarding**: Register, set KYC, configure pool allocations (total ≤ 100%).
3. **Payment**: Customer creates payment; merchant (or off-chain) processes: USDC transfer → fee split → net to pools/vault.
4. **Yield Handling**: Merchants claim/compound yields periodically.
5. **Withdraw/Refund**: From vault or proportional redemption from pools.
6. **Admin**: Manage fees, pause, withdraw platform funds.

## Security Considerations

- **Reentrancy**: Protected via `ReentrancyGuardComponent`.
- **Access Control**: Ownable for admin; caller checks for merchants.
- **Pause**: Emergency toggle halts non-view functions.
- **Allocations**: Enforced total ≤ 100%; no over-deposits.
- **Refunds**: Proportional; handles yield as extra fee.
- **Upgradability**: Proxy pattern; only owner upgrades.
- **Assumptions**: Pools are trusted (Vesu); no slippage/losses modeled.
